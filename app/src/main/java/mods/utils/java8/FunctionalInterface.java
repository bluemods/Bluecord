/**
 * An informative annotation type used to indicate that an interface
 * type declaration is intended to be a <i>functional interface</i> as
 * defined by the Java Language Specification.
 * <p>
 * Conceptually, a functional interface has exactly one abstract
 * method.  Since {@linkplain java.lang.reflect.Method#isDefault()
 * default methods} have an implementation, they are not abstract.  If
 * an interface declares an abstract method overriding one of the
 * public methods of {@code java.lang.Object}, that also does
 * <em>not</em> count toward the interface's abstract method count
 * since any implementation of the interface will have an
 * implementation from {@code java.lang.Object} or elsewhere.
 *
 * <p>Note that instances of functional interfaces can be created with
 * lambda expressions, method references, or constructor references.
 *
 * <p>If a type is annotated with this annotation type, compilers are
 * required to generate an error message unless:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> The type is an interface type and not an annotation type, enum, or class.
 * <li> The annotated type satisfies the requirements of a functional interface.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>However, the compiler will treat any interface meeting the
 * definition of a functional interface as a functional interface
 * regardless of whether or not a {@code FunctionalInterface}
 * annotation is present on the interface declaration.
