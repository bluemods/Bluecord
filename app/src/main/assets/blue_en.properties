# English translations for Bluecord
# (this is the base language)
#
# Many of these messages are passed through MessageFormat#format. You should keep the argument
# usages (e.g. {0}) intact and in meaningful positions in the message when translating.
#
# Most of these messages might need a space or something appended to the end of them - this
# is omitted in the properties file and added programmatically instead to avoid double spaces,
# missing spaces, and other similar issues. This should be honored when translating.
#
# If you are confused about the exact meaning of something you are translating, you should
# describe it in detail in your contribution to ensure an accurate translation for everybody.
