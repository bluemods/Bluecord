Source Code for Bluecord

All source code to build Bluecord is fully present, and you can verify its legitimacy for yourself.
Anyone claiming otherwise is intentionally lying to you for their own benefit (given this repo exists) and / or cannot write a single line of code if you asked them.

# Download
[Tap here to download Bluecord](https://bluesmods.com/bluecord/) and get started.<br>
The app has built-in update mechanisms, so you'll probably only need to do this once.

# Verifying Downloads
Bluecord 2.3 and up are signed with my signature in the V3 scheme.

To verify that the APK was signed by me and not tampered with, get [apksigner](https://developer.android.com/tools/apksigner) (version 0.9 or newer) and use the following command:

```bash
apksigner verify --print-certs path_to_bluecord_apk.apk
```

Expected output:
